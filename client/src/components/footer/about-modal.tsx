                At <strong>Charapia</strong>, we are redefining the way people
                create, own, and interact with digital characters. Built at the

              <p>
                We believe characters are more than drawings. They are

                give creators, collectors, and communities the tools to bring
                these characters to life in a way that is{" "}
                <strong>secure, decentralized, and truly theirs</strong>.
